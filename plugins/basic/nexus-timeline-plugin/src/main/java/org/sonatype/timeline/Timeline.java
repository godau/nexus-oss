 * (linearly, as they arrive, is "raw data". Not in timestamp order either!), and the indexer that builds a Lucene
 * index
 * from raw data used for retrievals and searches. This component also hides index failures, and keeps recording the
 * records in case of some Lucene index corruption: no data loss happens, but index must be rebuilt to make it again
 * retrievable as all {@link #retrieve(int, int, Set, Set, TimelineFilter, TimelineCallback)} calls will return empty
 * result sets.
