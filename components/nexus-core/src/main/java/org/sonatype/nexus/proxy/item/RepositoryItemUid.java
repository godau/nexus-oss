/**
 * Repository item UID represents a key that uniquely identifies a resource in a repository. Every Item originating
 * from Nexus, that is not "virtual" is backed by UID with reference to it's originating Repository and path within that
 * repository. UIDs are immutable.
 * <p/>
 * Note about "paths" used by this class. UID Paths are not FS file paths! They are always same on every platform, they
 * are more "URL-like" hierarchical paths. Separator is always same (see {@link RepositoryItemUid#PATH_SEPARATOR}) and UIDs does
 * not support notion of "relative paths". They always start with path separator and have 0 or more
 * path elements separated by path separator. They might or might not end with a path separator, telling do you
 * deal with a "collection" (aka "directory" or "folder") or not (represented by {@link StorageCollectionItem}).
 * Still, actual checking for file or collection is NOT recommended using checks for UID ending with a
 * path separator, you'd do the by retrieving item and something like {@code item intanceof StorageCollectionItem}!
 * <p/>
 * Few examples of UID paths:
 * <pre>
 *   /
 *   /foo
 *   /foo/bar/folder/
 * </pre>
 * Constructing UID instances that does not follow these requirements might lead to unexpected results!
 * This might change in future, where the path will be validated and sanitized (and by throwing exceptions
 * show you the location of bug in the code that tried to use invalid path for UID constructor).
 * For path utilities, see {@link PathUtils}.
